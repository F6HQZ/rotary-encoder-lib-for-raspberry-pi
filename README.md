# rotary-encoder-lib-for-raspberry-pi
to use as a library for easy use of rotary encoders without or with push switche in their axe, need "wiringPi" lib to work

 | My library permits an easy use of few rotary encoders with push switch |
 | in ther axe and use them as "objects" stored in structures. Like this, |
 | they are easy to read or modify values and specs from anywhere in your |
 | own software which must use them. Thanks to friends who have supported |
 | me for this project and all guys who have shared their own codes.      |
 | Enjoy !                                                                |
