# rotary-encoder-library-for-raspberry-pi
To use as a library for easy use a gang of rotary encoders without or with push switch in their axis, need "wiringPi" library to work.
Based on IRQ detection for a Raspberry Pi, includes a temptative to control undesired bounces and have some kind of universal object description for any bigger project.
Permits 4 rotations speeds level detection and pushed button duration detection.
Could be easily adapted for any C or C++ other computing platform.
